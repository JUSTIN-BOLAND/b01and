# What Is Web 3.0 and How Does It Work?

Much like any technology in the world, advancements take place and new versions are released. The internet is no different in this regard and we’re currently experiencing a revolution in the way that we access the internet.

Web 2.0 is currently what we refer to as the internet. This evolved from [Web 1.0](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27960/web-10) which is known as the earliest version of the internet. At the time, it was labelled as a global network that represented the future of digital communications. As the first iteration of the internet, it was primitive but covered the basics of what we needed the internet to do.

But as you might expect, new use cases for the internet were discovered and change was needed. With so many new applications and features being added over the years, the evolution of the web has been divided into three categories; Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0.

## What is Web 1.0?

Web 1.0 was the first version of the internet that was used roughly between 1991 and 2004. The majority of Web 1.0 users were content consumers and there were very few creators. Those who created websites were developers that built websites full of information in both text and image form.

A major limitation of Web 1.0 was the lack of interactivity. It was essentially a read-only web that used a static file system, meaning the content was never dynamic. As such, it was difficult to monetize Web 1.0 and security wasn’t as big of a concern yet.

## What is Web 2.0?

Web 1.0 was eventually superseded by Web 2.0 after 2004 and we’re still actively using this version of the internet. It opened up the internet to content creators and you no longer need development knowledge if you want to create a website. It’s far more accessible than before and allows for more interactivity and dynamic pages. Whether it’s uploading images, videos, or posting your own content on social media, these are all things that were enabled by Web 2.0.

This increased interactivity was a double-edged sword. While it allowed for more dynamic web pages and interesting uses for the internet, it also created security problems. Since users could interact with the internet in different ways, it led to many early exploits and vulnerabilities being discovered. Since the increased interactivity allowed companies to monetize their users, it created more incentive for bad actors to discover security flaws that could be used for monetary or informational gain.

Lastly, Web 2.0 is largely a centralized system. Users have little control or say in how their data is stored or used, and some internet systems are monitored by governments that can seize bank accounts and disable access to certain information if they deem that it goes against their values.

## What is Web 3.0?

At its core, Web 3.0 is the decentralization of the internet. Web 3.0 aims to create more self-governing systems that allow developers to run their websites and applications on blockchains. This means decentralized networks that are formed from many different peer to peer nodes instead of a single central server.

This is assisted by concepts such as the [Interplanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/), also known as IPFS. This is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol that is designed to preserve and grow humanity’s knowledge by creating a more resilient internet system that is more open and upgradeable. Its goal is to replace Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) which is currently used for secure communications over the internet. You may have noticed that the majority of websites are currently prefixed with “https://”. This is for the sake of keeping communications between your device and the server private.

There are already many great examples of excellent Web 3.0 usage. For example, [Apple’s Siri](https://www.apple.com/uk/siri/) makes use of voice recognition which is quickly becoming a key component of Web 3.0. With machine learning, artificial intelligence, and enhanced voice recognition algorithms, personal assistants like Siri will make browsing the web much easier and more efficient than it is today.

Another good example of Web 3.0 usage is with Wolfram Alpha, a computational intelligence platform that is often used by students and professionals across many different fields such as mathematics, nutrition, and science. Wolfram Alpha uses Web 3.0 by reading information from users across multiple databases whenever a question is answered. It will then streamline the information for end-users by interpreting the question and returning a relevant and comprehensive answer.

Technology advances according to the needs of its users. Web 3.0 is just a natural progression of the internet and will focus on giving users more flexibility, customisation, and unique ways to interact with the plethora of information available on the internet.
